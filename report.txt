Summary: Since processes are added on a queue basis and
they run until finish, there will always only be one process
in memory at one time. (non-preemptive)

Advantages: Only memory needed for the current process is 
stored in memory. This simplifies memory management as
there is no need for swap space.

Disadvantages: The non-preemptive nature of the algorithm 
causes long processes at the front of the queue to hog up
running time, as shorter processes have to wait until
these long processes at the front to finish.

time 0, 1 running, numprocesses=1, numholes=1, memuseage=50%
time 100, 2 running, numprocesses=1, numholes=1, memuseage=10%
time 101, 3 running, numprocesses=1, numholes=1, memuseage=20%
time 102, 4 running, numprocesses=1, numholes=1, memuseage=30%
time 103, simulation finished

As this simulation shows, short processes (2,3,4) have to wait
until the long process (1) finishes. Thus, the FCFS scheduler
has a long average wait time - making it useless for programs
with a lot of user input.
