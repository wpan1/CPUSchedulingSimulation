First Come First Serve

Summary: Since processes are added on a queue basis and
they run until finish, there will always only be one process
in memory at one time. (non-preemptive)

Advantages: Only memory needed for the current process is 
stored in memory. This simplifies memory management as
there is no need for swap space.

Disadvantages: The non-preemptive nature of the algorithm 
causes long processes at the front of the queue to hog up
running time, as shorter processes have to wait until
these long processes at the front to finish.

time 0, 1 running, numprocesses=1, numholes=1, memuseage=50%
time 100, 2 running, numprocesses=1, numholes=1, memuseage=10%
time 101, 3 running, numprocesses=1, numholes=1, memuseage=20%
time 102, 4 running, numprocesses=1, numholes=1, memuseage=30%
time 103, simulation finished

As this simulation shows, short processes (2,3,4) have to wait
until the long process (1) finishes. Thus, the FCFS scheduler
has a long average wait time - making it useless for programs
with a lot of user input.

Multi-Level Feedback Queue

Summary: The multiple levels allow for shorter processes to
complete without waiting for longer processes to finish. Longer
processes are put into lower priorities so they don't hog CPU
time.

Advantages: Preemptive nature of the algorithm gives every
shorter jobs an overall higher priority as they finish before
being pushed to a lower priority.

Disadvantages: If a large job has a high priority, it make take
a long time to finish if there is an influx of low burst time
processes.

0 1 50 100
0 2 20 2
0 3 20 2
0 4 20 2
time 0, 1 running, numprocesses=1, numholes=1, memuseage=50%
time 2, 2 running, numprocesses=2, numholes=1, memuseage=70%
time 4, 3 running, numprocesses=2, numholes=1, memuseage=70%
time 6, 4 running, numprocesses=2, numholes=1, memuseage=70%
time 8, 1 running, numprocesses=1, numholes=1, memuseage=50%
...
time 100, 1 running, numprocesses=1, numholes=1, memuseage=50%
time 106, simulation finished

If this simulation was expanded to have an even larger influx of
short processes (2,3,4), the long process (1) would have to
wait until all processes finish before proceeding. Therefore,
despit its priority, it would be the slowest to finish.

Memory Mangement - First Fit Algorithm

Summary: First Fit Algorithm places processes into the first
available space

Advantages: Allocations into memory are as quick as possible.
Fastest out of all fitting algorithms.

Disadvantages: In some cases,
